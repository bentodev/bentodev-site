This is a very brief look at Bento's main features, with examples but with
little background or explanation.  For a more in-depth account, see 
<a href="overview?article=leisurely_tour">A More Leisurely Tour of Bento</a>.   

###Bento Concepts

Bento is a declarative language.  A Bento program is a specification 
of output objects.  Typically, Bento runs as a web server and the
objects being specified are web pages.

Bento programs consist of <b>definitions</b> and <b>constructions</b>.
A construction is a statement that yields output.  There are several
kinds of constructions:

* Blocks (code or data)
* Control statements (loops, conditionals and redirections)
* Expressions
* Instantiations
* Literal values (strings, characters, booleans or numbers)

An example of each of the above, with comments:

    /* a data block */
    [| <h1>Hello, World.</h1> |]

    /* a conditional statement */
    if (say_hello) [=
        hello_world;
    =]

    /* an expression */
    ("<h1>Hello, " + user_name + ".</h1>");
    
    /* an instantiation */
    hello_world;
    
    /* literal values */
    "<h1>Hello, World.</h1>";
    true;
    3.14159;

Note that constructing an expression, instantiation or literal value requires
appending the construction operator <code>;</code> to the statement, whereas
constructing a block or a control statement does not.

###Definitions
    
A definition is a named and optionally typed set of Bento statements, which
may be any combination of definitions or constructions. The following is a 
definition of <code>hello</code>, of type <code>page</code>, which contains 
one definition and one construction:

    page hello [=
        hello_world [|
            <h1>Hello, World.</h1>
        |]
    
        hello_world;
    =]

Definitions take various forms.  In a <b>block definition</b> the body of the
definition is a block. Both definitions in the above example are block definitions.
The body of <code>hello</code> is a code block, delimited by <code>[=</code> and 
<code>=]</code>.  The body of the contained definition, <code>hello_world</code>, 
is a data block, delimited by <code>[|</code> and <code>|]</code>.  If a definition
contains exactly one construction and zero definitions another form is available,
an <b>element definition</b>.  Here is the definition of <code>hello_world</code>
rewritten in element form:

    hello_world = "<h1>Hello, World.</h1>"
    
There is also a shorthand form for an empty definition, i.e. a definition containing
zero definitions and zero constructions:

    hello_nobody [/]
    
And there is a special form for an abstract definition, which has no implementation
rather than an empty implementation, and therefore throws an error if you try to
instantiate it:
 
    abstract_hello [?]

Other forms exist for collection definitions.  They will be presented in a later
section.

###Bento Entities

A Bento definition defines a named Bento entity.  Whereas most languages distinguish 
between types, functions, variables, etc., in Bento there is just one category of entity, 
but a range of roles an entity can play, depending on the context the entity is in as
well as the specific properties of the entity.:

* The one role that every entity plays is type. If a definition is abstract, i.e. has no 
implementation, then type is the only role the defined entity can play.  The type role
occurs when the definition's name is specified as another definition's type.

* If a definition has constructions, then the entity can play the role of 
function.  Instantiating a definition is the equivalent of calling a function,
with the return value being the output specified by the definition's constructions.    

* If a definition contains definitions, then the defined entity can play the role of 
interface.

* By default, when a definition is instantiated, the value is cached, and if the definition
is referenced again in the same scope the cached value is used instead of constructing the
value again. Such a definition can play the role of a variable.

* A definition can specify that a child definition's value be cached along with its parent.
Such a definition can play the role of an object. 



###Collections

It is possible to define collections in Bento.  There are two kinds of collections,
<b>arrays</b> and <b>tables</b>.
